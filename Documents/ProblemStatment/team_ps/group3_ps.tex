        Code3 Visionary aims to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict need for emergency services.
        We will use data from various sources, such as prior emergency services call and dispatch logs, to build predictive models for emergency event densities in a given time and place. 
        These predictive models will be used to provide more input to Levrum's existing Code3 Strategist software, which allows users to build what-if scenarios based on hypothetical scenarios and various resource parameters.

\section{Definition}
Levrum Data Technologies aims to optimize emergency services resource allocation.
Levrum's existing software, Code3 Strategist, optimizes placement of emergency service resources based on what-if analyses.
In what-if analyses, users can adjust various parameters, such as response times, station locations, and workload to see the expected outcome of various hypothetical emergency situations.
Levrum wants to enhance this functionality by using predictive algorithms to generate what is likely to occur and use those likely scenarios as input into the what-if analyses. \par

\section{Proposed Solution}
 The goal of Code3 Visionary is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict need for emergency services in a given time and place.
 We will begin by researching machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to best fit Code3 Visionary's particular needs. One anticipated challenge is that we have access to a large amount of some types of data, such as emergency event time, location, and cause, but some sets of data we may be using will be sparse.
 Initial research will be aimed at the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What algorithms will yield the greatest predictive power, given the amount and types of data we have?
    \item What algorithms are best suited for this type of predictive model?
    \item What data is useful in making these predictions?
\end{itemize}
Although the proposed solution is subject to change depending on what research yields, a few design decisions are reasonably certain. Our proposed solution involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementing the algorithms with the highest yield in predictive power in a back-end calculation engine. 
    \item Training the algorithms with data from prior events.
    \item Producing output that looks like an emergency dispatch call log.
    \item Implementing a REST API that will give Code3 Strategist access to Code3 Visionary's results.
    \item Updating Code3 Strategist's code base to get results from Code3 Visionary.
\end{enumerate}

We will need to implement a back-end calculation engine that will include algorithms for developing predictive models.
We will concurrently need to build connectors to condition the data necessary for training these algorithms.
The algorithms and connectors will be prioritized based on return-on-investment; that is, how much predictive power we can expect to gain.
Further, since the ultimate goal of the project is a set of machine learning algorithms that are accessible by Code3 Strategist, we will need to implement a fully encapsulated REST API.
Code3 Strategist will then have access to the new predictive models via API calls.
Lastly, we will need to plug the new functionality into Code3 Strategist. \par

Though a lot of design decisions will be informed by further research, the ultimate goal is a set of pluggable machine learning algorithms that can be used by the existing Code3 Strategist to build more robust what-if scenarios.

\section{Metrics}
Metrics for success in this project fall into three categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Predictive model.} 
    We will build a trained model, containing algorithms that we will train with prior data to generate predictions for future incidents. 
    At this time, we are unsure about how much predictive power we can expect our model to have. 
    A minimal metric is for the implemented algorithms to consistently achieve better than baseline accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Rest API capabilities.} We will have an API that Code3 Strategist can use to obtain a predicted dispatch call log, which it will in turn use to create a what-if analysis on likely emergency events. We will design a set of API calls that will allow Code3 Strategist to send and receive data from the calculation engine. The REST API must, at a minimum, be able to get results in the form of generated dispatch call logs from the predictive algorithms we implement.
    
    \item \textbf{Data connectors.} Data being input into machine learning algorithms must be conditioned for the calculation engine. Different databases, even those holding similar data, will likely be configured with different schemas, and we will certainly be dealing with various types of data. We must determine what data will yield the greatest predictive power, prioritize those data, and implement connector modules to condition the data.
